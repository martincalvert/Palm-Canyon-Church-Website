<h4>What do you have for kids?</h4>	
On Sundays the Nursery (birth-3) and PreSchool (4-K) class are both safe and loving environments for your young children.  Our pre-screened and background-checked childcare leaders share the love of Jesus with your children and help them feel secure. The ROCK (for grades 1-5) is a cool church for kids.  Every weekend, kids are greeted by our warm and friendly team of ROCK leaders (pre-screened and background-checked)!  You child will hear the Bible presented in an interactive, creative way so they will be able to apply those truths to their lives.  On Thursday nights during the school year your child has the opportunity to participate in a mid-week kids’ club called AWANA (ages 3-grade 5).

<h4>What do you have for teens?	</h4>During the 9a service on Sundays there is a Bible study for both middle schoolers (grades 6-8) and high schoolers (grades 9-12).  Both studies begin immediately following the music in the main service.  On Tuesday nights (7-8:30p) your middle schooler can attend DV8 (the youth group designed for middle schololers) and on Wednesday nights (7p-8:45p) your high schoolers can attend ImpACT (the youth group designed for high schoolers).  Both youth groups bring a biblical message of hope and challenge every week using cutting edge videos, fun games and music to shatter stereotypes about church.
