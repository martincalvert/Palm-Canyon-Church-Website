        <h3>This is the perfect place for imperfect people</h3>
	<p>
       	 <ul>
          <li>God loves imperfect people. We are not content to play church by just huddling up with a bunch of Christians pretending to be perfect. We want to be in a place where real, worldly, imperfect people, with real messy lives are seeing the real, perfect God in action.</li>
          <li>We are building a grace-first culture — In a culture of grace is where people grow best. Such a culture requires trusting that God's Spirit can work behind the scenes in people's hearts as we create that culture where they are free to question, doubt and explore faith at their own pace. People will learn a lot about God by the way we act, interact and treat them.</li>
          <li>Grace is acceptance. We must learn to accept people as they are without any condemnation and draw near in a relationship, like God wishes — not for the purpose of changing them, that's God's job — but for the purpose of embodying how God feels about them. We have no unwritten entrance requirements, unspoken rules designed to keep the "wrong" people out; we don't check IDs at the door or run background checks on every person who walks through the doors of our church or small groups. Instead, we fling the doors wide open and truly invite all outsiders. But acceptance isn't the same as agreement with a person's choices, beliefs, or behaviors. We say "come as you are, but don't stay that way"</li>
