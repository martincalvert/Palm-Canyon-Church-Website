        <h3>Relationships </h3>We desire for each child to experience a saving relationship with Jesus Christ. We also value children’s relationships within the small group setting as they relate to their small group leader and other children within the group. As families commit to attending the same service each week, children are placed in a group of familiar faces where relationships can grow!</div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>Age Appropriateness</h3>We are passionate about children learning about Jesus in a way they understand. Our environments and lesson materials are created based on the physical, mental and emotional needs of each child.
        </div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>Safety</h3>We believe that safety is vital as families entrust us with their children each week. Therefore, every child’s name tag is matched to a parent-identification number, every volunteer is screened with an interview and background check.</div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>Creative Bible Teaching</h3>The Bible is the most amazing book ever written! We strive to bring its stories to life through activities and discussions that keep children engaged. We want all children to love God’s word and understand the value of applying it to their lives.</div>

        <h3>Fun!</h3>Kids love fun! We realize that when children have fun at church, they can’t wait to come back. We value creating fun ways for children to learn about Jesus.</div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>First Time at PC Kids?</h3>
        A friendly host will be happy to show you to the area your child will be enjoying the morning. Nursery and Preschool classes are near the main auditorium. Grade School, known as “The Rock” for kids, is in the modular. We will ask for the following personal information on the provided registration card: family member’s names, children’s names and birthdates, family address, phone number, and any special instructions (allergies, special needs) for your child. On your way home, be sure to ask your child: “Did you have fun?” and “What did you learn today?”</div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>A Special Note</h3>If for some reason your child were to need you during the service, your last four digits of your phone number would appear on the screens in the auditorium.  We will also text you if you specify on sign-in sheet.  We would ask that you exit the auditorium immediately and look for a staff member who will direct you to your child’s room.</div>
        <div class="span3"><h3>What Should I Expect When I Return to PC Kids?</h3>
        As you enter any department at PC KIDS, your first stop should be at one of our Check in Stations where a friendly volunteer will check your child in for the service you are attending. Our start stations open 10 minutes prior to the start of each service. Please fill in the check in sheet completely so we have no mistakes should your child need you. Please be sure to ask any of our amazing volunteers or staff if you have questions about our values, policies or procedures. Thanks for checking out PC KIDS!
