      <p>On Sundays the Nursery (birth-3) and PreSchool (4-K) class are both safe and loving environments for your young children.  Our pre-screened and background-checked childcare leaders share the love of Jesus with your children and help them feel secure. The ROCK (for grades 1-5) is a cool church for kids.  Every weekend, kids are greeted by our warm and friendly team of ROCK leaders (pre-screened and background-checked)!  Your child will hear the Bible presented in an interactive, creative way so they will be able to apply those truths to their lives.  On Thursday nights during the school year your child has the opportunity to participate in a mid-week kids’ club called AWANA (ages 3-grade 5).</p>
