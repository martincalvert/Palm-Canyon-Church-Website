        <h4>"But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us--see that you also excel in this grace of giving." 2 Cor. 8:7 (NIV)</h4>
        <p>Throughout Scripture, we are reminded of the importance of giving back a portion of what God has provided for our use. His Word tells us that giving is an act of worship that should be done with a spirit of thanksgiving. Even though we live in a consumer-driven culture that tells us that acquiring "things" is so important, the truth of God's Word hasn't changed - He still calls us to give to others and to the work of His church.<br><br>Palm Canyon Community Church offers a number of ways for you to provide financial support to the ministries of our church.
