        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><p><h4>DV8 (6th - 8th Grade)</h4>
        DV8 (Deviate) is our mid-week program designed to reach out to all middle school students, especially those who do not go to church. Teams compete in a lot of fun, high-energy games before learning about God during our "God Time." Our optional small group time is a great way for students who are serious about God to get more involved by connection with a leader who cares about them.<br><b>Tuesdays</b><br>6:30 pm - DV8 Small Groups<br>7:00 pm - DV8<br><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/DV8-Palm-Canyon/296512720440396"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> DV8 On Facebook</a></p></div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h4>DV8 Sunday Morning (6th - 8th Grade)</h4>DV8 Sunday Morning is for those who want to learn and grow in their Christian lives! Every week is a little bit different, but basically it includes a time of singing and worship, great Bible study, powerful prayer times, caring friends and loads of fun. As students grow in their understanding of God's Word, they will also get to know God in a personal way and see how their lives can be changed by knowing Him.<br><b>Sundays</b><br>9:00 am</div>
