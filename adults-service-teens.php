      <p>During the 9a service on Sundays there is a Bible study for both middle schoolers (grades 6-8) and high schoolers (grades 9-12).  Both studies begin immediately following the music in the main service.  On Tuesday nights (7-8:30p) your middle schooler can attend DV8 (the youth group designed for middle schololers) and on Wednesday nights (7p-8:45p) your high schoolers can attend ImpACT (the youth group designed for high schoolers).  Both youth groups bring a biblical message of hope and challenge every week using cutting edge videos, fun games and music to shatter stereotypes about church.</p>
